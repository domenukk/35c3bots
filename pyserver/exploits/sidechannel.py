[MISC] - Hard
This challenge is all about wee/dev/null.
Huh.. How would we ever get the flags out if we can't print?
Should we break out of Node?
Well while this might be an option,,, it's definitely not the one we are looking for as part of a Junior Challenge.

Instead, we can use a nice timing attack with self-made timing code:
in case we find the correct flag, pause() and/or loop.

For speedup, we can use binary search, however it's not needed to solve the challenge.

Finally we (slowly) get back the Flag:

    try:
        requests.post("http://{}/wee/dev/null".format(host), json={"code": code}, timeout=3)
        return False
